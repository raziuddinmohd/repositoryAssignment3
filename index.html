                   I'm completely new to UI/UX design and this is my very first css work in my life , and I found my self enthusiastic as am moving ahead designing this portifolio. Initially it is very difficult to get started,because I was very much messed up like how to start, from where to start. but <strong>Aditya sir</strong> was always my motivation to keep on moving, when ever I got stuck, I try to understand the concept again by watching the videos.
